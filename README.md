# Server-Pinger
A tool that 'pings' any host you input and checks if it replies back. If it replies back it's considered 'online'. Originally, this was made to check the status of some MapleStory game servers but it can also be used for any other server type.

- Pings any specified host + port combo and reports the reply time

- Has variable ping delays - can even go as low as 1 second

- Option to auto-launch any specified .exe upon successful ping

- Lets you choose a .mp3 file to play upon host response

- Double click listbox to autofill Host + Port textboxes

- Option to use either TCP or ICMP for ping
